The 555 timer in this circuit is there to generate a square wave that will be fed into 2 shift registers. This is done with the help of a capacitor and a resistor, in which the frequency of the generated sine wave is about 1Hz (This can be changed to your liking). This square wave is fed into 2 74HC595 shift registers cascaded with each other that are setup as a Johnson counter. This is done by tying the last input of the counter back into the input. Assmuming the shift register's output start at 0 (most of the time if the 4.7uF bypass capacitor is placed), Q1 and R19-R20, acting as an inverter, will invert the last output (0 when the device is started) to a 1 and feed that into the data input of the first shift register. Then, on the next clock cycle generated by the 555, that 1 input will be shifted down, turning on the first LED. The input 1 keeps in beign shifted down, eventually turning on all LEDs. When the 1's are shifted to the last input, the inverter then ouputs a 0 to the data input of the shift register. This repeats the same process as shifting down the 1 input, turning off LEDs incrementally. The cycle repeats when the 0 input gets shifted down into the last output, where it gets inverted into a 1 and fed into the input of the first shift register.

D18-21 are independent of this circuit, and are simply constantly on. A SMD-1206 LED can be used if titled 90Â° while soldered. There are optional, and should be used with a laser engraved 31.5x31.5mm acylic piece or a 30x30 picture.
