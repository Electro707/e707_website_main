The circuit is based on the 555 timer. The chip, if set up as done in this circuit, will act as an oscillator, which will generate a square wave on the output, in which the frequency is dependent on R1, R2, and C1. With the chosen values, the output will have a frequency of 1.2Hz, also meaning the output will oscillate once every 0.85 seconds. This output is used to drive the 12 LEDs on the board directly.
