The circuit is based on a 555 timer and a 4017 decade counter. The 555 timer is set to operate as a astable multivibrator. The clock output of the 555 is connected to the 4017 decade counter. This counter then incremently turns on a "channel" at a time. Each "channel" signal is connected to a Darlington array in order to drive the potential 4 LEDs connected per channel. Each "channel" output has 2 LEDs connected to it in the main board, and 1 in each auxilary board. The auxilary boards are not required for the operation of the main board, but is recommeded to solder them on, mainly because they look cool.
