I am Jamal Bouajjaj, a college junior at the University of New Haven. I take enjoyment in designing circuits and PCBs as well programming microcontrollers.
I have developed countless projects (most of them needing a documentation), ranging from your basic Arduino example project to designing my own OLED business card.
This website serves as a showcase of all of my projects that has been documented so far.
