This project is a PCB soldering kit in the shape of pierced heart. The LEDs on the arrow incrementally illuminates one by one, then incrementally turns off in the same fashion. This kit has a 30x30mm hole in the center of it, which is meant to be used as a picture or engraved-acrylic frame. There are 4 SMD right angle LEDs on the back for the option to light up an acrylic frame than can be placed in the frame hole with the assistance of a custom designed case, which can be found in the Google Drive folder.
