This project is a PCB soldering kit in the shape of a christmas tree. The 3D parts of the projects comes from connection the main PCB and 2 "auxilary" PCB thru a right angle connector. The kit has been designed with some SMD and THT parts. If you plan to use this design as a kit for people who have no/minimal soldering experience, it is recommended to pre-solder the SMD parts before giving the board to them for them to solder.
