Welcome to my first blog-ish. If you somehow remember, I've had my own blog setup where I had a PHP program parse thru a file with a custom program using \[\] as commands of sorts. Well time went on, and I've noticed that my own system became much of a burden. And thus why this blog site is served and created with Jekyll using the jekyll-theme-console theme. Check both of them bellow:

[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
[jekyll-theme-console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console)

Hopefully this change, allowing me to use markdown for posting blogs, will get me to do more of them (I really should). As for the previous post made with my original blog setup, I will port it here (and why you will see it bellow this one datewise).
