# USRP2920
The [USRP2920](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.usrp-2920.html) is a decently high research SDR, with a simultaneous TX and RX frequency range of 50 to 2.2Ghz.

I was able to get my hands on a USRP2920 thru my university (University of New Haven), and I decided (with prior permission of course) to tear-down the SDR and have a look what's inside, as well as take (what I hope are) decent quality images of the inside. 

I will eventually write a description for what I noticed, but it is 2am at the time I am writing this, so for now it will just be a picture dump.
