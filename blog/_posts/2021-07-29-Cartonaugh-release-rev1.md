Finally after months of work, and some more of laziness, I've released Rev1.0 of my Cartonaugh package. It's now available on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/cartonaugh?) which is nice. Of course, it's always available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Electro707/Cartonaugh) as well.

## Cartonaugh?

If you aren't aware what this is, it's a package which I forked from *2pi's* *karnaugh-map* package. It's a LaTeX package that draws K-Maps, used in digital systems. Here is an example of one generated by this package:

My fork includes mutlitude of changes, including:

- Changing the backend to exclusively use LuaLaTeX for it's Lua capability
- Added to the point above, major improvements to the backend
- Improvement to how the K-Map and it's variables and stuff are layed out with TikZ
- Added the 45 degree line at the top-left of the k-map
- Added a command to change the colors
- Added the option to have a 5 or 6 variable K-map to be seperated or stuck together with a thick line seperator
