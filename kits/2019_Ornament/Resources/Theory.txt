The circuit is based on the 555 timer. The chip, if set up as done in this circuit, will act as an oscillator which will generate a square wave on the output where the frequency is dependent on R1, R2, and C1. With the chosen values, the output will have a frequency of 1.2Hz(the output will oscillate once every ~0.85 seconds). This output is used to drive 6 LEDs when the output is a LOW. The other 6 LEDs are set to be on when the output of the 555 is a HIGH, but this can be changed with the 2 available jumpers (WARNING: If changed the jumper incorectly, you can possible short out either the 555 or the power supply. If you want to change the other 6 LEDs so they blink with the first 6, cut the short in the jumper on the PCB with a knife, then solder the middle pad to the pad that wasn't previously connected(refer to schematic for details))
