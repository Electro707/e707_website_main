The circuit is based on an Attiny85 microcontroller. This microcontroller controls all LEDs at once with a 2N3904 transistor. There is a copper pad underneath the left eye, which serves as the capacitance touch pad. The CapacitiveTouch library is used in conjunction with a pre-determined threshold value to determine the when the pad has been pressed or not. When pressed, the Attiny changes the LED driving mode in software (from off, to fading, to blinking, then back to off).
